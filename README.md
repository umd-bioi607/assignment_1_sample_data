# Test input and output data for BIOI 607 Assignment 1

* The output `sars_cov2_sa_64.stat` in `test_output` was made by running `inspectsa` on the suffix array of the test `sars_cov2` genome with a sampling factor of `64`.

* The output `salmonella_sa_128.stat` in `test_output` was made by running `inspectsa` on the suffix array of the test `salmonella` genome with a sampling factor of `128`.

* The output `sars_reads1.naive.map` in `test_output` directory was made by running `querysa` on the suffix array of `sars_cov2` with `test_input/reads1.fa` as input in `naive` mode, and the `simpaccel`  variant was made in the corresponding way.
